## ✅ What Was Delivered

### 1. Dedicated Admin Login Page ✅

  - Rejects unauthorized emails
  - Auto sign-out if not authorized
  - Clear error message shown

### 3. Route Protection ✅
- **Public Routes**:
  - `/login` - Student login
  - `/admin/login` - Admin login
- **Protected Routes**:

  - `/student/*` - Student only
  - `/pending` - Pending approval
- **Redirects**:
  - Non-admin accessing `/admin/login` → redirected to `/login`
  - Non-admin accessing `/admin/*` → redirected to `/login`

### 4. Role-Based Access Control ✅
- **Admin Role**: Can access admin panel, manage students
- **Student Role**: Can access student dashboard, take exams
- **Pending Role**: Can only see "Account Pending" page

### 5. Complete Student Approval Workflow ✅
- Student registers via `/login`
- Student sees "Account Pending" page
