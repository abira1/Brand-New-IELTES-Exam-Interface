## 📊 Database Structure

### Students Path
```
students/
  {uid}/
    uid: string
    email: string

    status: 'pending' | 'approved' | 'rejected'
    createdAt: ISO timestamp

Submissions Path:
- Read: Admin OR own submission
- Write: Admin OR own submission
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "Failed to load students" in Admin Panel

**Check 1**: Verify admin whitelist exists
- Go to Firebase Console → Database → Data
- Check `admin/whitelist` path exists
- Verify your email is there

**Check 2**: Verify email format
- Use email exactly as it appears in Google Auth
- Example: `toiral.dev@gmail.com` (not normalized)

**Check 3**: Check browser console
- Open DevTools (F12)
- Go to Console tab
- Look for Firebase permission errors

**Check 4**: Verify database rules deployed
- Go to Firebase Console → Database → Rules
- Check rules are updated

### Student still sees "Account Pending" after approval

**Solution**:
1. Sign out completely
2. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
3. Close browser completely
4. Reopen and sign in again

### Admin cannot see students

**Check**:
1. Verify admin email in `admin/whitelist`
2. Verify email format (no normalization)
3. Verify database rules deployed
4. Check browser console for errors
