# Import Questions Issue - RESOLVED ✅

**Date**: October 19, 2025  
**Issue**: JSON upload returns HTML error instead of JSON response  
**Status**: ✅ FIXED & BACKEND RUNNING

---

## 🎉 Issue Summary

### The Problem
When uploading a JSON file from DeepSeek to the Import Questions page, users received:
```
Failed to execute 'json' on 'Response': Unexpected token '<', "<!doctype "... is not valid JSON
```

### Root Cause
The backend server (`functions/server.js`) was NOT running on port 5001. When the frontend tried to upload JSON:
1. Frontend sent request to `/functions/uploadJson`
2. Proxy tried to connect to `http://localhost:5001/uploadJson`
3. Connection failed (backend not running)
4. Browser returned HTML error page
5. Frontend tried to parse HTML as JSON
6. Error: "<!doctype" is not valid JSON

---

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### 1. Started Backend Server
```bash
cd functions
node server.js
```

**Result**:
```
✅ Backend Server Running
📡 Listening on http://0.0.0.0:5001
📝 Project: exam-interface-shah-sultan
```

### 2. Improved Error Handling
Updated `frontend/src/services/functionsService.js` with:
- Detailed console logging for diagnostics
- Better error detection (HTML vs JSON responses)
- Clear error messages indicating backend status
- Response header inspection

### 3. Verified Endpoints
- ✅ `/healthCheck` - Working
- ✅ `/uploadJson` - Working
- ✅ All other endpoints - Available
