## üí° Key Points

### Why Local Works
- setupProxy.js routes `/functions` to localhost:5001
- Express server handles requests
- Data saved to Firebase

### Why Production Didn't Work
- No `/functions` endpoint on Firebase Hosting
- Spark plan doesn't support Cloud Functions
- No backend to handle requests

### How Fix Works
- Path 1: Deploy Cloud Functions (Blaze plan)
- Path 2: Deploy backend to external service
- Frontend automatically routes to correct backend
