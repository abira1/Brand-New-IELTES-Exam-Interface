## ❌ If Something Is Wrong

```
❌ Firebase rules not deployed correctly
✅ Solution: Check if rules were deployed
✅ Solution: Hard refresh the page (Ctrl+Shift+R)
✅ Solution: Clear browser cache and reload
```

### If Approve Button Doesn't Work
```
❌ Admin permissions issue
✅ Solution: Check if admin email is in whitelist
✅ Solution: Verify email normalization
✅ Solution: Check console for specific error
```

### If Student Can't Access Dashboard After Approval
```
❌ Student role not updated
✅ Solution: Sign out and back in
✅ Solution: Clear browser cache
✅ Solution: Check student status in Firebase Console
```

### If Admin Can't See Students
```
❌ Firebase initialization issue
✅ Solution: Check console for Firebase errors
✅ Solution: Verify admin is authenticated
✅ Solution: Hard refresh the page
```

## 📊 What Changed

### Firebase Rules Updated
```json
// BEFORE (WRONG)
".write": "auth != null && auth.uid === $uid"

// AFTER (CORRECT)
".write": "auth != null && (auth.uid === $uid || root.child('admin/whitelist').child(auth.token.email.replace('.', '_').replace('@', '_')).exists())"
```

### Why It Works
- Allows students to write to their own records
- Allows admins (in whitelist) to write to any student record
- Maintains security
