# Import Questions - Complete Fix & Testing Guide

**Date**: October 19, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ BACKEND RUNNING & READY FOR TESTING  
**Issue**: JSON upload returns HTML error instead of JSON response

---

## 🎉 Issue Resolved

### Root Cause Identified
The backend server (`functions/server.js`) was NOT running on port 5001. When the frontend tried to upload JSON, the proxy connection failed and returned an HTML error page instead of JSON.

### Solution Applied
1. ✅ Started backend server: `node functions/server.js`
2. ✅ Verified server is running on port 5001
3. ✅ Confirmed `/uploadJson` endpoint is accessible
4. ✅ Improved error handling in `functionsService.js`

## 🧪 Testing the JSON Upload

### Prerequisites
- ✅ Backend server running on port 5001
- ✅ Frontend running on port 3000
- ✅ JSON file ready: `deepseek_json_20251019_0dba87.json`
- ✅ Admin account with access to Import Questions

### Step 1: Verify Backend is Running
```bash
# In a terminal, check if backend is running
curl http://localhost:5001/healthCheck

# Expected response:
# {"status":"ok","service":"IELTS Platform Functions (Local)","timestamp":"..."}
```

### Step 2: Start Frontend (if not running)
```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```

### Step 3: Navigate to Import Questions
1. Open browser: http://localhost:3000
2. Log in as admin (shahsultanweb@gmail.com or toiral.dev@gmail.com)
3. Navigate to: Admin Panel → Exam Management → Import Questions

### Step 4: Upload JSON File
1. Click "Select File" or drag-and-drop
2. Select: `deepseek_json_20251019_0dba87.json`
3. Verify exam title is auto-filled: "IELTS Reading Partial"
4. Click "Upload"

### Step 5: Monitor Console Logs
Open browser console (F12) and look for:

**Success Logs**:
```
📤 [uploadJson] Starting JSON upload...
📤 [uploadJson] URL: /functions/uploadJson
📤 [uploadJson] File: deepseek_json_20251019_0dba87.json Size: 12345 bytes
📤 [uploadJson] Exam Title: IELTS Reading Partial
📤 [uploadJson] Response status: 200
✅ [uploadJson] Upload successful: {
  "success": true,
  "examId": "uuid-here",
  "message": "JSON imported successfully",
  "data": {
    "title": "IELTS Reading Partial",
    "totalQuestions": 40,
    "sections": [...]
  }
}
```

**Error Logs** (if backend not running):
```
📤 [uploadJson] Response status: 404
❌ [uploadJson] Backend returned HTML instead of JSON
❌ [uploadJson] Error uploading JSON: Backend error (HTTP 404): Backend server may not be running...
```

## ✅ Expected Success Indicators

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Backend server may not be running"
**Check**:
```bash
curl http://localhost:5001/healthCheck
```

**Fix**:
```bash
cd functions
node server.js
```

### Issue: "Port 5001 already in use"
**Find process**:
```bash
# Windows
netstat -ano | findstr :5001

# macOS/Linux
lsof -i :5001
```

**Kill process**:
```bash
# Windows
taskkill /PID <PID> /F

# macOS/Linux
kill -9 <PID>
```

### Issue: "Firebase initialization error"
**Check**: Backend console for Firebase errors
**Solution**: Backend falls back to client SDK automatically

### Issue: "Invalid JSON format"
**Check**: JSON file structure matches expected format
**Verify**: File is valid JSON (use online JSON validator)

## 📋 JSON File Structure

The uploaded JSON file should have this structure:

```json
{
  "title": "IELTS Reading Partial",
  "section": "Reading",
  "duration": 60,
  "passages": [
    {
      "passageNumber": 1,
      "title": "Passage Title",
      "text": "Passage content...",
      "questions": [
        {
          "type": "true_false_ng",
          "number": 1,
          "text": "Question text",
          "answer": "True",
          "points": 1
        }
      ]
    }
