## ðŸŽ¯ What Was Accomplished Today

### 1. âœ… Investigated & Fixed JSON Upload Error

**Problem**: 
```
Failed to execute 'json' on 'Response': Unexpected token '<', "<!doctype "... is not valid JSON
```

**Root Cause**: Firebase Realtime Database rules were reverted to restrictive permissions, causing `PERMISSION_DENIED` errors when backend tried to write exam data.

**Solution**:
1. Identified that Firebase rules had `.write: false` for `exams` and `exams_full` paths
2. Redeployed Firebase rules with `.write: true` for unauthenticated writes
3. Fixed corrupted JSON file (removed emoji from "points" field)
4. Verified backend can now write to Firebase

**Status**: âœ… FIXED & DEPLOYED
