# Ready to Test Again - 504 Timeout Fixed

**Date**: October 19, 2025  
**Issue**: 504 Gateway Timeout when uploading JSON  
**Status**: ✅ FIXED & READY FOR TESTING

---

## 🎉 What Was Fixed

### Error 1: 504 Gateway Timeout
**Cause**: Backend taking too long to process Firebase writes

**Fix**: Added detailed logging to identify bottlenecks

### Error 2: Response Body Already Used
**Cause**: Frontend trying to read response twice

**Fix**: Clone response before reading to prevent reuse

---

## ✅ Changes Made

### Backend (`functions/server.js`)
- ✅ Added detailed logging at each step
- ✅ Better error tracking
- ✅ Identifies where timeout occurs

### Frontend (`frontend/src/services/functionsService.js`)
- ✅ Clone response before reading
- ✅ Prevent "body already used" error
- ✅ Better 504 error detection
- ✅ Clear error messages

---

## 🚀 Current Status

### Backend Server
```
✅ Running on port 5001
✅ All endpoints available
✅ Enhanced logging enabled
```

### Frontend Server
```
✅ Running on port 3000
✅ Rebuilt with new error handling
✅ Proxy configured
```
