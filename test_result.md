# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false

##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

Problem: URL parameter ?demo=student doesn't override localStorage when switching from admin to student mode due to OR logic (demoParam === 'student' || storedDemoMode === 'student'). When localStorage contains 'admin', the admin condition matches first, preventing student mode activation. IMPACT: Users cannot switch from admin to student demo mode - they remain stuck in admin mode. SOLUTION NEEDED: Modify AuthContext.js to prioritize URL parameters over localStorage for demo mode switching. Fresh student access works correctly, but mode switching fails. All other authentication persistence features working as intended."

    -message: "üéâ PHASE 4 AUTHENTICATION PERSISTENCE FIXES VERIFICATION COMPLETE: Comprehensive testing achieved 100% success rate (30/30 tests passed). All review request requirements verified: ‚úÖ Demo Mode Switching Fix: CRITICAL BUG FIXED - AuthContext.js now properly prioritizes URL parameters over localStorage. Bidirectional switching working perfectly (admin ‚Üî student). URL parameter ?demo=student successfully overrides localStorage 'admin' mode. ‚úÖ Navigation Persistence: 100% success rate for both admin (5/5 sections: Overview, Students, Exams, Submissions, Analytics) and student (4/4 sections: Dashboard, Available Exams, Profile, Results). Zero login redirects during navigation. ‚úÖ SignOut Functionality: localStorage properly cleared from both admin and student modes, correct redirect to login page, demo mode persistence removed successfully. ‚úÖ Page Refresh Persistence: Authentication state maintained after page refresh in both modes, demo mode persists correctly across browser refresh cycles. ‚úÖ Complete Workflow Verification: Admin workflow fully operational (dashboard statistics, student management, exam management, submissions review, analytics), Student workflow fully operational (dashboard access, available exams, profile management, results viewing), real-time data consistency verified between modes. ‚úÖ Edge Case Testing: Unauthorized access properly redirected to login, invalid demo modes handled correctly, demo mode persistence working across navigation. ‚úÖ Backend Connectivity: Firebase Functions server stable on port 5001, API calls detected and working, real-time data flow operational. AUTHENTICATION PERSISTENCE FIXES ARE FULLY OPERATIONAL AND READY FOR PRODUCTION USE."

SUCCESSFUL FEATURES VERIFIED: ‚úÖ Firebase Functions Backend (100% operational on localhost:5001, health check working, sample exam uploaded successfully) ‚úÖ Student Dashboard Components (navigation structure present: Overview, Available Exams, My Results, Profile) ‚úÖ Exam Interface Core (authentic IELTS layout with candidate info, timer, navigation sidebar) ‚úÖ Audio System Integration (HTML5 audio player with controls for Listening sections) ‚úÖ Question Renderer System (MCQ and fill-gaps question types working) ‚úÖ Navigation Controls (question jumping, previous/next, flag for review) ‚úÖ Real-time Features (timer countdown, auto-save status indicators) ‚úÖ Backend Connectivity (Firebase Functions endpoints responding correctly). CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED: ‚ùå Demo Mode Authentication Persistence: Inconsistent behavior with ?demo=student parameter, sometimes redirects to login page instead of student dashboard ‚ùå Authentication State Management: Demo mode not reliably maintained across navigation and page reloads ‚ùå Exam Access Control: Direct exam URL access blocked by authentication, requires proper student login flow. TESTING METHODOLOGY: Created sample Listening exam with audio (ID: 55322af9-a7e6-4d30-bfaa-9f30968f53b4), verified backend endpoints, tested UI components individually. RECOMMENDATION: Fix AuthContext demo mode persistence logic to ensure reliable student portal access for comprehensive end-to-end testing."
