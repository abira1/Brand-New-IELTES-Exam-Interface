# Import Questions - Final Summary & Resolution

**Date**: October 19, 2025  
**Issue**: JSON upload returns HTML error instead of JSON response  
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED & READY FOR TESTING

---

## 🎉 Issue Resolution Summary

### Problem Identified
When uploading a JSON file from DeepSeek to the Import Questions page:
```
Error: Failed to execute 'json' on 'Response': Unexpected token '<', "<!doctype "... is not valid JSON
```

### Root Cause Found
The backend server (`functions/server.js`) was NOT running on port 5001. The frontend proxy tried to connect to a non-existent server and received an HTML error page instead of JSON.

### Solution Implemented
1. ✅ Started backend server: `node functions/server.js`
2. ✅ Verified server running on port 5001
3. ✅ Confirmed `/uploadJson` endpoint accessible
4. ✅ Improved error handling in `functionsService.js`
5. ✅ Added detailed console logging for diagnostics
