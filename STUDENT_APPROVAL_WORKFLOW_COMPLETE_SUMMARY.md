## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Issue #1: Firebase Initialization (FIXED)
- **Problem**: Admin panel couldn't fetch students
- **Solution**: Fixed `isFirebaseEnabled` check in `databaseService.js`
- **Result**: Admin panel can now fetch students from Firebase

### Issue #2: Admin Approval Permissions (FIXED)
- **Problem**: Admins couldn't update student records
- **Solution**: Updated Firebase rules to allow admin writes
- **Result**: Admins can now approve/reject students

### Issue #3: Real-Time Redirect (FIXED)
- **Problem**: Students not automatically redirected on approval
- **Solution**: Added Firebase listener to `PendingApproval` component
- **Result**: Students automatically redirected when approved
