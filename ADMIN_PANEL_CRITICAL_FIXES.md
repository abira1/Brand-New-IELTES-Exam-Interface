## 🎯 Critical Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: Students Not Appearing in Admin Panel ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: New students were not appearing in Student Management section despite registering successfully

**Root Cause**: 
- StudentManagement was using `databaseService.getAllStudents()` (correct)
- But other components were still using `functionsService` which calls Cloud Functions
- Cloud Functions not deployed, returning HTML error pages instead of JSON
- This caused cascading failures in dependent components

**Solution**: 
- Migrated ALL components from `functionsService` to `databaseService`
- Added missing methods to `databaseService` for admin operations
- All components now use direct Firebase Realtime Database access

**Result**: ✅ Students now appear correctly in Student Management

---

### Issue 2: Analytics Section Broken ✅ FIXED

**Errors Fixed**:
```
❌ Error fetching students: SyntaxError: Failed to execute 'json' on 'Response'
❌ Error fetching exams: SyntaxError: Failed to execute 'json' on 'Response'
❌ Error fetching submissions: SyntaxError: Failed to execute 'json' on 'Response'
❌ Uncaught ReferenceError: Badge is not defined
```

**Changes Made**:
1. Added missing `Badge` import from `../ui/badge`
2. Changed `functionsService.getStudents()` → `databaseService.getAllStudents()`
3. Changed `functionsService.getExams()` → `databaseService.getExams()`
4. Changed `functionsService.getSubmissions()` → `databaseService.getSubmissions()`

**File**: `frontend/src/components/admin/Analytics.jsx`

**Result**: ✅ Analytics section now loads without errors

---

### Issue 3: Submission Review Broken ✅ FIXED

**Error Fixed**:
```
❌ Error fetching submissions: SyntaxError: Failed to execute 'json' on 'Response'
```

**Changes Made**:
1. Changed `functionsService.getSubmissions()` → `databaseService.getSubmissions()`

**File**: `frontend/src/components/admin/SubmissionReview.jsx`

**Result**: ✅ Submission Review section now loads without errors

---

## 📋 All Components Migrated

### Student Components
- ✅ **AvailableExams.jsx**: `functionsService.getExams()` → `databaseService.getAvailableExams()`
- ✅ **MyResults.jsx**: `functionsService.getSubmissions(user.uid)` → `databaseService.getStudentSubmissions(user.uid)`

### Admin Components
- ✅ **Analytics.jsx**: All three methods migrated + Badge import added
- ✅ **SubmissionReview.jsx**: `functionsService.getSubmissions()` → `databaseService.getSubmissions()`
- ✅ **ExamManagement.jsx**: `functionsService.getExams()` → `databaseService.getExams()`

### Database Service
- ✅ **databaseService.js**: Added 3 new methods:
  - `getExams()` - Get all exams for admin
  - `getSubmissions(studentUid)` - Get all submissions or filter by student
  - `getExamById(examId)` - Get full exam details

```javascript
// Get all exams (admin)
async getExams() {
  // Returns all exams with metadata
  // Used by: Analytics, ExamManagement, AvailableExams
}

// Get all submissions (admin)
async getSubmissions(studentUid = null) {
  // Returns all submissions or filtered by student
  // Used by: Analytics, SubmissionReview, MyResults
}

// Get exam by ID with full details
async getExamById(examId) {
  // Returns full exam data from exams_full path
  // Used by: ExamInterface, ExamDetails
}
```

### Import Changes

**Before**:
```javascript
import functionsService from '../../services/functionsService';
```

**After**:
```javascript
import databaseService from '../../services/databaseService';
```

### Method Call Changes

**Before**:
