# Backend Verification & Frontend Integration Guide

## ‚úÖ Question 1: Is "Cannot GET /" Normal?

**YES, this is completely normal!** ‚úÖ

Your Express API backend doesn't need a root route (`/`). It's designed to serve specific endpoints like:
- `/healthCheck` - Server health status
- `/uploadJson` - JSON file upload
- `/uploadZip` - ZIP file upload
- And 15+ other endpoints

This is the correct behavior for a REST API backend.

## ‚úÖ Question 2: Test /healthCheck Endpoint

**YES, test this to verify the backend is working!**

### Test in Browser

Open this URL in your browser:
```
https://brand-new-ieltes-exam-interface.onrender.com/healthCheck
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "message": "Server is running",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-19T..."
}
```

### Test with curl (if you have it)

```bash
curl https://brand-new-ieltes-exam-interface.onrender.com/healthCheck
```

## ‚úÖ Question 3: Next Steps - Frontend Integration

### Step 1: Update Frontend .env

Edit `frontend/.env` and change:

**FROM:**
```
REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=https://firebase-setup-2.preview.emergentagent.com
```

**TO:**
```
REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=https://brand-new-ieltes-exam-interface.onrender.com
```

### Step 2: Rebuild Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
cd ..
```

### Step 3: Deploy to Firebase Hosting

```bash
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

## ‚úÖ Question 4: Yes, Update and Redeploy

**Exactly right!** Here's the complete process:

### Complete Integration Checklist

- [ ] Test `/healthCheck` endpoint (verify backend is running)
- [ ] Update `frontend/.env` with new Render URL
- [ ] Run `npm run build` in frontend folder
- [ ] Deploy with `firebase deploy --only hosting`
- [ ] Wait 2-3 minutes for Firebase to update
- [ ] Test JSON upload on production website
