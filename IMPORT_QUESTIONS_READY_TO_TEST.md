## 🔍 What Was Wrong

### The Error
```
Failed to execute 'json' on 'Response': Unexpected token '<', "<!doctype "... is not valid JSON
```

### The Root Cause
Backend server (`functions/server.js`) was NOT running on port 5001. When the frontend tried to upload JSON:
1. Frontend sent request to `/functions/uploadJson`
2. Proxy tried to connect to `http://localhost:5001/uploadJson`
3. Connection failed (backend not running)
4. Browser returned HTML error page
5. Frontend tried to parse HTML as JSON
6. Error: "<!doctype" is not valid JSON

---

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### 1. Backend Server Started
```bash
cd functions
node server.js
```

**Status**: ✅ Running on port 5001

### 2. Frontend Error Handling Enhanced
**File**: `frontend/src/services/functionsService.js`

**Improvements**:
- Detailed console logging
- HTML vs JSON detection
- Clear error messages
- Response header inspection

### 3. Endpoints Verified
- ✅ `/healthCheck` - Working
- ✅ `/uploadJson` - Working
- ✅ All endpoints - Available
