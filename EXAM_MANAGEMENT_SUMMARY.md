# Exam Management System - Complete Summary

## 🔍 Investigation Results

### Current Problem
After successfully importing a JSON exam, there's **NO WAY** to:
- ❌ Publish the exam
- ❌ Make it visible to students
- ❌ Activate it for taking
- ❌ Organize it into collections
- ❌ Schedule its availability

**Result:** Imported exams are invisible to students!

### Root Cause
Imported exams are saved with:
```javascript
{
  status: 'draft',
  published: false,
  is_visible: false,
  is_active: false
}
```

Students only see exams where ALL THREE are true:
```javascript
exam.published && exam.is_visible && exam.is_active
```

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Database Schema Enhancements

**Exam Metadata** (add these fields):
```javascript
{
  status: 'draft' | 'published' | 'archived',
  published: boolean,
  is_visible: boolean,
  is_active: boolean,
  track_id: string (optional),
  difficulty: 'beginner' | 'intermediate' | 'advanced',
  availableFrom: timestamp (optional),
  availableUntil: timestamp (optional)
}
```

**New: Exam Tracks**
```javascript
/exam_tracks/{trackId}
{
  id: string,
  name: string,
  description: string,
  difficulty: string,
  exams: [examId1, examId2, ...],
  createdAt: timestamp
}
```

### Code Changes

**databaseService.js:**
```javascript
// Add this method
async updateExam(examId, updates) {
  await update(ref(database, `exams/${examId}`), updates);
  await update(ref(database, `exams_full/${examId}`), updates);
  return { success: true };
}
```

**ExamManagement.jsx:**
```javascript
// Add these handlers
const handlePublish = async (examId) => {
  await databaseService.updateExam(examId, {
    status: 'published',
    published: true
  });
  toast.success('Exam published');
  fetchExams();
};

const handleActivate = async (examId) => {
  await databaseService.updateExam(examId, { is_active: true });
  toast.success('Exam activated');
  fetchExams();
};

const handleMakeVisible = async (examId) => {
  await databaseService.updateExam(examId, { is_visible: true });
  toast.success('Exam is now visible to students');
