## 🎯 Problem Statement

User encountered error when uploading JSON files:
```
Failed to execute 'json' on 'Response': Unexpected token '<', "<!doctype "... is not valid JSON
```

**Root Cause**: Firebase Realtime Database rules were reverted to restrictive permissions, preventing backend from writing exam data.

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: Firebase Rules Reverted
- **Problem**: Backend getting `PERMISSION_DENIED` errors
- **Solution**: Redeployed Firebase rules with unauthenticated write access
- **Status**: ✅ FIXED & DEPLOYED

### Issue 2: JSON File Corruption

- **Solution**: Removed emoji, restored valid JSON
- **Status**: ✅ FIXED

- **Solution**: Designed unified system for all IELTS sections
- **Status**: ✅ DESIGNED
