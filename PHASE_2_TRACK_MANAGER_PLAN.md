# Phase 2: Track Manager Implementation Plan

## 🎯 Objective
Simplify exam management workflow by introducing a centralized Track Manager that allows admins to:
1. Publish exams with one click (instead of three)
2. Manage exam visibility and status in one place
3. Organize exams into tracks/collections
4. Provide real-time updates to students

---

## 📋 Requirements Analysis

### Current Workflow (Phase 1):
```
Import JSON → Click [Publish] → Click [Activate] → Click [Make Visible] → Done
(4 steps, 3 clicks)
```

### Proposed Workflow (Phase 2):
```
Import JSON → Click [Publish to Track] → Done
(2 steps, 1 click)
```

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### New Components:
1. **TrackManager.jsx** - Main track management interface
2. **TrackList.jsx** - Display all tracks
3. **TrackEditor.jsx** - Create/edit tracks
4. **ExamInTrack.jsx** - Manage exams within a track
5. **PublishToTrackModal.jsx** - Quick publish dialog

### New Routes:
- `/admin/tracks` - Track Manager main page
- `/admin/tracks/:trackId` - Track details

### Database Schema:
```
/exam_tracks/{trackId}
├── id: string (UUID)
├── name: string
├── description: string
├── difficulty: "beginner" | "intermediate" | "advanced"
├── exams: [examId1, examId2, ...]
├── createdAt: timestamp
├── createdBy: string (admin uid)
└── updatedAt: timestamp

/exams/{examId} - Add field:
├── track_id: string (optional)
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### 1. Database Service Methods

**New methods to add to `databaseService.js`:**

```javascript
// Track Management
async createTrack(trackData) { }
async updateTrack(trackId, updates) { }
async deleteTrack(trackId) { }
async getTracks() { }
async getTrackById(trackId) { }

// Exam-Track Association
async addExamToTrack(examId, trackId) { }
async removeExamFromTrack(examId, trackId) { }
async publishExamToTrack(examId, trackId) { }

// Real-time Listeners
onTracksChange(callback) { }
onTrackExamsChange(trackId, callback) { }
```

### 2. Component Structure

**TrackManager.jsx:**
- Display list of tracks
- Show exams in each track
- Toggle exam visibility/status
- Create new track button

**PublishToTrackModal.jsx:**
- Show after successful import
- List available tracks
- Create new track option
- Auto-publish exam to selected track

### 3. Real-time Updates

**Student Dashboard:**
- Listen to `/exams` for changes
- Listen to `/exam_tracks` for changes
- Update exam list when visibility changes
- No page refresh needed
