# Investigation Complete - Status Report

**Date**: October 19, 2025  
**Issue**: Import Questions JSON upload returns HTML error  
**Status**: ✅ INVESTIGATION COMPLETE & ISSUE RESOLVED

---

## 🎯 Investigation Summary

### Issue Reported
When uploading a JSON file from DeepSeek to the Import Questions page:
```
Error: Failed to execute 'json' on 'Response': Unexpected token '<', "<!doctype "... is not valid JSON
```

### Investigation Performed
1. ✅ Examined JSON file - Valid and properly formatted
2. ✅ Examined frontend component - Correctly implemented
3. ✅ Examined backend endpoint - Correctly implemented
4. ✅ Examined proxy configuration - Correctly configured
5. ✅ Checked backend server status - NOT RUNNING
6. ✅ Identified root cause - Backend server not on port 5001

### Root Cause Found
The backend server (`functions/server.js`) was NOT running on port 5001. When the frontend tried to upload JSON, the proxy connection failed and returned an HTML error page instead of JSON.

---

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### 1. Backend Server Started
```bash
cd functions
node server.js
```

**Result**: ✅ Server running on port 5001

### 2. Frontend Error Handling Enhanced
**File**: `frontend/src/services/functionsService.js`

**Changes**:
- Added detailed console logging
- Detect HTML vs JSON responses
- Provide clear error messages
- Inspect response headers

**Result**: ✅ Better diagnostics and error messages

### 3. Endpoints Verified
- ✅ `/healthCheck` - Working
- ✅ `/uploadJson` - Working
- ✅ All endpoints - Available
