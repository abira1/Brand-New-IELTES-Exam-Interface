The complete student approval workflow is now fully functional and production-ready.

## 🔴 Problems That Were Fixed

### Problem 1: Pending Students Not Appearing in Admin Panel

**What Was Wrong**:
- Students registered successfully with Google OAuth
- Students saw "Account Pending" page correctly
- BUT students did NOT appear in Admin Panel → Student Management
- Admin list appeared empty even though students had registered

**Root Cause**:
The `getAllStudents()` method in `databaseService.js` had issues:
- No proper null/undefined handling
- No default values for student fields
- No error logging for debugging
- Could fail silently if data structure was unexpected

**How It Was Fixed**:
Enhanced the `getAllStudents()` method with:
- Explicit null/undefined checks
- Default values for all student fields
- Proper error logging
- Data validation and mapping

**Result**: ✅ Students now appear correctly in Student Management list

---

### Problem 2: Refresh Button Not Working

**What Was Wrong**:
- Clicking the refresh button did nothing
- No visual feedback (no spinner, no disabled state)
- No success/error messages
- No way to know if refresh was working

**Root Cause**:
The refresh button had no:
- Loading state management
- Visual feedback mechanism
- User notifications
- Distinction between initial load and refresh

**How It Was Fixed**:
1. Added `refreshing` state to track refresh action
2. Added spinning icon that animates during refresh
3. Added "Refreshing..." text during refresh
4. Disabled button during refresh
5. Added success toast notification
6. Added console logging for debugging

**Result**: ✅ Refresh button now works with clear visual feedback
