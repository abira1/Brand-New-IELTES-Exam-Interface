## 📊 What Changed

### File Modified
- `frontend/src/services/databaseService.js`

### What Was Fixed
```javascript
// BEFORE (WRONG)
const isFirebaseEnabled = database && database.ref && typeof database.ref === 'function';

// AFTER (CORRECT)
const isFirebaseEnabled = database !== null && database !== undefined;
```

### Why It Matters
- Before: Firebase was always disabled in admin panel
- After: Firebase is properly enabled in admin panel
- Result: Admin can now fetch students from Firebase

---

## 🎯 Expected Results

### Before Fix
```
Admin Panel: "No students found"
Console: "Firebase enabled: undefined"
Result: ❌ Students don't appear
```

### After Fix
```
Admin Panel: Shows list of students
Console: "Firebase enabled: true"
Result: ✅ Students appear correctly
```

---

```

```

### Issue: Console shows errors

3. Verify Firebase rules are correct
4. Check if student data exists in Firebase
```

### Issue: Admin can't log in
