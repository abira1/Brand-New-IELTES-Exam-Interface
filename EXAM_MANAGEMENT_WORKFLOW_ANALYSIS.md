# Exam Management Workflow Analysis

## üîç Current State Investigation

### 1. What Happens After JSON Import?

**Current Flow:**
```
Admin uploads JSON ‚Üí Backend saves to Firebase ‚Üí Success message shown ‚Üí DEAD END ‚ùå
```

**Problem:** After successful import, there's NO next step. The exam is saved but:
- ‚ùå Not visible to students
- ‚ùå Not published/activated
- ‚ùå No way to organize it
- ‚ùå No way to make it available

### 2. Current Database Schema

**Exam Metadata** (`exams/{examId}`):
```json
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "title": "IELTS Reading Partial",
  "type": "full_test",
  "duration": 60,
  "totalQuestions": 40,
  "status": "draft",
  "published": false,
  "is_visible": false,
  "is_active": false,
  "createdAt": "2025-10-19T...",
  "sections": [...]
}
```

**Full Exam Data** (`exams_full/{examId}`):
```json
{
  "...metadata...",
  "questions": [40 questions with full details]
}
```

### 3. Student Access Logic

**Current Filter** (in `databaseService.getAvailableExams()`):
```javascript
const exams = Object.values(data).filter(exam => 
  exam.published && exam.is_visible && exam.is_active
);
```

**Problem:** Imported exams have:
- `published: false` ‚ùå
- `is_visible: false` ‚ùå
- `is_active: false` ‚ùå

So students see NOTHING!

### 4. Existing Admin Components

**ExamManagement.jsx:**
- ‚úÖ Shows list of all exams
- ‚úÖ Shows exam metadata (title, duration, questions, sections)
- ‚úÖ Has "View", "Edit", "Delete" buttons (NOT IMPLEMENTED)
- ‚ùå NO "Publish" button
- ‚ùå NO "Activate" button
- ‚ùå NO "Make Visible" button
- ‚ùå NO status management

**ExamImport.jsx:**
- ‚úÖ Handles JSON file upload
- ‚úÖ Shows success message with exam details
- ‚ùå NO "Next Steps" guidance
- ‚ùå NO "Publish Now" button
- ‚ùå NO redirect to exam management
