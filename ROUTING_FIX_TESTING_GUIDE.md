## 🎯 What Was Fixed

### 1. **Route `/admin` Redirect** ✅
- **Before**: `/admin` redirected to `/login`
- **After**: `/admin` redirects to `/admin/login` for unauthenticated users
- **For Admins**: `/admin` redirects to `/admin/dashboard`

### 2. **Admin Login Accessibility** ✅
- **Before**: `/admin/login` required authentication
- **After**: `/admin/login` is publicly accessible (no auth required)

### 3. **Email Validation Redirects** ✅
- **Authorized Admin**: Redirects to `/admin` (Admin Dashboard)
- **Unauthorized User**: Redirects to `/login` (Student Login) after 2 seconds
- **Error Message**: Clear message shown before redirect

### 4. **Route Protection** ✅
- **Admin Routes** (`/admin/*`): Redirect unauthenticated users to `/admin/login`
- **Student Routes** (`/student/*`): Redirect unauthenticated users to `/login`
- **Cross-Role Access**: Admin accessing student route → redirects to `/admin`
