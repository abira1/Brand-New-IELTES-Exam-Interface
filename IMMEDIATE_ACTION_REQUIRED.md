## 🧪 IMMEDIATE TESTING REQUIRED

### Step 1: Clear Browser Cache (IMPORTANT!)
1. Press `Ctrl+Shift+Delete` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+Delete` (Mac)
2. Select "All time"
3. Check "Cookies and other site data"
4. Click "Clear data"
5. Close and reopen browser

### Step 2: Register a Test Student
1. Visit: https://exam-interface-shah-sultan.web.app
2. Click "Continue with Google"
3. Sign in with a test email (e.g., `test.student.ielts@gmail.com`)
4. **Expected**: You should see "Account Pending" page

### Step 3: Check Browser Console During Registration
1. Open Browser Console (`F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+I`)
2. Go to "Console" tab
3. Look for logs starting with `👤 [createUserProfile]`
4. **Expected logs**:
   ```
   👤 [createUserProfile] Starting to create/update user profile
   👤 [createUserProfile] Firebase enabled: true
   ✅ [createUserProfile] User profile created successfully
   ```

**If you see errors**:
- ❌ `Firebase enabled: false` → Firebase not initialized
- ❌ Permission denied → Database rules issue
- ❌ Other errors → Note the error message

### Step 4: Verify Data in Firebase Console
1. Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/exam-interface-shah-sultan/database/data
2. Look for `students` path
3. **Expected**: You should see your test student record
4. **Structure**:
   ```
   students/
     {uid}/
       uid: "..."
       email: "test@gmail.com"
       displayName: "..."
       status: "pending"
       createdAt: "..."
   ```

**If no students appear**:
- ❌ Check if `students` path exists
- ❌ Check if records are being created
- ❌ Check Firebase rules

### Step 5: Sign In as Admin
1. Sign out from test student account
2. Click "Continue with Google"
3. Sign in with admin email: `shahsultanweb@gmail.com`
4. You should see Admin Dashboard

### Step 6: Check Admin Panel
1. Go to Admin Panel → Student Management
2. **Expected**: Your test student should appear in the list
3. **Expected stats**: "Pending: 1"

### Step 7: Check Admin Panel Console Logs
1. Open Browser Console (`F12`)
2. Look for logs starting with `📋 [StudentManagement]`
3. **Expected logs**:
   ```
   📋 [StudentManagement] Fetching students from database...
   🔍 [getAllStudents] Starting to fetch all students...
   ✅ [getAllStudents] Total students: 1
   📋 [StudentManagement] Successfully fetched 1 students
   ```

**If students don't appear**:
- ❌ Check if `Total students: 0`
- ❌ Check if `Snapshot exists: false`
- ❌ Check error messages

### Step 8: Test Approve/Reject
1. Find your test student in the list
2. Click "Approve" button
3. **Expected**: Status changes to "approved"
4. **Expected**: Success toast appears

### Step 9: Verify Student Access
1. Sign out from admin account
2. Sign in as test student
3. **Expected**: You should see "Student Dashboard" (not "Account Pending")
4. **Expected**: You can access all sections
