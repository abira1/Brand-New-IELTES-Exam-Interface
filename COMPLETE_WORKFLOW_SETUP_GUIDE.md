## 📋 Admin Whitelist Configuration (REQUIRED)

### Step 1: Access Firebase Console
1. Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/exam-interface-shah-sultan/database/data
2. You should see the database structure

### Step 2: Create Admin Whitelist Path
1. Click on the "+" button next to "admin" (or create "admin" if it doesn't exist)
2. Create a new child called "whitelist"
3. Inside "whitelist", create entries for each admin email

### Step 3: Add Admin Emails (Normalized Format)
**Important**: Email addresses must be normalized (replace `.` and `@` with `_`)

**Admin 1: shahsultanweb@gmail.com**
- Path: `admin/whitelist/shahsultanweb@gmail_com`
- Value: `true`

**Admin 2: [PLEASE PROVIDE SECOND ADMIN EMAIL]**
- Path: `admin/whitelist/{normalized_email}`
- Value: `true`

### Example: How to Normalize Email
```
Original: shahsultanweb@gmail.com
Normalized: shahsultanweb@gmail_com
(Replace . with _ and @ with _)
```

### Step 4: Verify in Firebase Console
```
admin/
  whitelist/
    shahsultanweb@gmail_com: true
    [second_admin_email_normalized]: true
```

- Students start with 'pending' status
- Admins must approve students before they can access dashboard
