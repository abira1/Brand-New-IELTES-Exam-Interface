## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Upload Still Fails?
1. Check browser console (F12)
2. Look for error message
3. Check backend logs
4. Verify environment variables

### 404 Error?

## 🎉 Summary

### What's Done
✅ Local JSON upload working perfectly  
✅ Code enhanced for production  
✅ Two deployment paths provided  
✅ Complete documentation created  

### What You Need to Do
1. Choose Path 1 or Path 2
2. Follow the steps
3. Test production upload

### Timeline
**5-15 minutes to production** ✅

## 💡 Key Points

### Why Local Works
- setupProxy.js routes `/functions` to localhost:5001
- Express server handles requests
- Data saved to Firebase

### Why Production Didn't Work
- No `/functions` endpoint on Firebase Hosting
- Spark plan doesn't support Cloud Functions
- No backend to handle requests

### How Fix Works
- **Path 1**: Deploy Cloud Functions (Blaze plan)
- **Path 2**: Deploy backend to external service
- Frontend automatically routes to correct backend
